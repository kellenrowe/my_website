                <p class="p2">  
                San Fransisco startup Cloverbook provides software that helps event professionals (DJ's, Photographers, etc.) acquire, manage, and interact with their clients.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Brief:</b> In May of 2020 I began working with Cloverbook to address accumulating user feedback and an opportunity for growth in one of the company's key performance indicators (KPIs) - Activation. Cloverbook considers a user activated after they create three events.

            <p class="p2"> Before my first meeting with the team I signed up for the free trial so I could walk through the site as a first time user. With a background in wedding photography and live performance, I was curious to see how the site felt to me - a 31 year old, tech-savvy, former event pro.<br><br>
                
            During my own user journey, I struggled to understand where the site wanted me to go and how it wanted me to get there. I felt unaccomplished, even after creating an event. <br><br>

            <h2 class="subHeaderB">User Research</h2>

            <p class="p2">After communicating with the team about my experience, we decided to dive deeper into the initial experiences of our users via two methods; 1) user observation 2) data analysis. </p> <br>
            
            <h3 class="subHeaderC"><b>Research Goals</b></h3>

            <ul class="p2" id="indent">
                <li>Discover path to key drop off points after initial sign-up.</li> 
                <li>Prioritize related aggregate user feedback.</li> 
            </ul> <br>

            <h3 class="subHeaderC"><b>Methodology - User Observation</b></h3>
                <p class="p2">
                    We identified 100 non-activated users to observe. All user observations took place via desktop. Because our goal was to understand the path to key drop off points, we cataloged the following information after new users would land on their home page; 
                </p>
            <ul class="p2" id="indent">    
                <li>Which buttons were clicked first on each screen</li>
                <li>Number of clicks that navigated back/home</li> 
                <li>Which buttons were clicked multiple times</li> 
                <li>Which buttons were not clicked.</li>
                <li>From which screen drop off occurred.</li> 
                <li>Elapsed time from login to drop off.</li> 
            </ul> <br>

            <h3 class="subHeaderC"><b>Methodology - Data Analysis</b></h3>
                <p class="p2">
                    To prioritize user feedback related to activation we used a matrix model to first categorize each submission. After categorizing feedback from over 900 submissions we focused on the green quadrant - procedural inquiries.
                </p> <br>
            <img src="infographic.png" alt="" id="infographic"><br>

                <p class="p2">
                    With all procedural inquiries isolated, we tallied and ranked each similar submission with the highest number of tallies being ranked number one. The green box below contains the topics users felt they needed help with.

            <h2 class="subHeaderC">User Behavior</h2>
            <p>57% of users dropped off within two minutes of first login. <br> 70% within five minutes. 
            
            <br><br> On average, users didn't complete an event creation until their third time on the event creation page. <br><br> Nearly all users navigated one click forward and one click back for their first four clicks. <br><br> 10% of users found the "New" button for document creation. <br> 0 users collaborated with a client, or created a new document. <br> 63% of users dropped off from the Event page. <br> 22% from the Home page, and the remainder from various pages. <br><br>

                <h3>Core functionality has low discoverability and multiple tools complete the same task.</h3>
                    <p class="p2"> Measured user behavior shows initial confusion is the result of having multiple paths to the same destination. As the color-coded image below shows, new users land on a page where two thirds of the clickable options are duplicates. <br> <br>
                    Additionally three of Cloverbook's key functionalities (Pipeline, Financials, and Lead Capture) are hidden inside dropdown menus and have extremely low discoverability.<br><br>

            <h3>Eliminate duplicates and minimize dropdown content.</h3>
                <p class="p2"> To make the user's path to event creation less ambiguous we removed all duplicate buttons. We also grouped related tools closer together to allow for an associative understanding of functionality. This process  allowed us to bring Pipeline and Financials out into the global nav., increasing discoverability and user understanding of the software's capabilities. <br> <br>
                Lastly, we added a notification badge to the Pipeline tool - cueing the user to see that Lead Capture is actively bringing in leads. <br><br>

            <h3>Affordance of Workspaces is ambiguous and low discoverability discourages exploration and document creation. </h3>
                <p class="p2"> Observed behavior overlaps several procedural inquiries showing new users aren't seeing or understanding the "New" button, the "Workspaces" button, and the relationship between the two. When users do discover the elements, they spend considerable time attempting to comprehend what each affords and how they work together. This consistently leads to tasks being left incomplete and in some cases unnecessarily restarted.

            <h3>Change the names of <i>Workspaces</i> and <i>New</i>. <br> Modify element mapping.</h3>
                <p class="p2"> By changing the names to <i>Event Documents</i> & <i>New Document</i>, respectively, the conceptual model becomes  tangible to the user and the affordance of each is made clear. Moreover, bringing the <i>New Document</i> element into horizontal alignment with the <i>Event Documents</i> element increases discoverability. Lastly, to encourage element exploration, the interaction is changed to mouse-over instead of a click.

            <h3>Users are confused about meaning and purpose of Event List. </h3>
                <p class="p2"> After users create an event, a list is started on their home page. The list is color coded by booking status, however, under the status quo, no key is provided and very little information can be derived from the page. Furthermore, user observation shows many new users [due to a lack of feedback] click back into the event to verify their input saved correctly. <br><br>

                <p class="p2"> Bringing the event and contact information into the user's event list will provide instant feedback that their input has been saved while simultaneously affording rapid information recall and contact utilization. <br><br>
                Additionally, with the booking status tool now color coded and built into the event list, users are provided with a key and the means to adjust the status from whichever page suits their needs. <br><br>

            <h3>Weak signifiers and low discoverability for primary and secondary CTA's in document creation. </h3>
                <p class="p2"> Under the status quo, when users create a document, there is document tool bar in the upper right hand section of the page. When users complete the document they are scrolled well below visible range of the toolbar. The result is that users are often unaware of how to share their documents or even that sharing is the next step. In best case scenarios the user scrolls back to the top of the page to share or utilize any tools. Furthermore, the current font color (#DEDEDF) is misleading and signifies that the tools are inaccessable.

                <p class="p2"> Fixing the toolbar div will enable the user to see and utilize the CTA's at any point in their creation of a document. <br><br>
                Changing the color of secondary CTA's to #323232 (which the style guide dictates) will signify that the tools are available for use. <br> <br>
                Lastly, pulling "Share" (the primary CTA) out of the list and converting it to a standard Cloverbook button provides a cue for the user's attention and action.

                <p class="p2"> Measuring user behavior allowed us to identify pain points leading to drop off and create human centered solutions to mitigate the decrease in user activation.
                Qualitative analysis of user emails enabled us to understand and address user needs in the aggregate. In these respects this project met the research goals and fullfilled the needs of Cloverbook users.

            <h3 class="subHeaderA">Challenges</h3>
                <p class="p2"> Constraints on budget limited our ability to broaden the methodology of our research. With screen recordings and user feedback being the only tools at our disposal, it was challenging to identify root causes of user confusion with certitude. Quantitative data collection, cross analysis with user feedback, and a highly iterative process were paramount in the success of this collaborative project.
